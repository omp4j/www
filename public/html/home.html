		<h2>Example usage <small>in 10 seconds</small></h2>
		<p class="lead">
			Let us show you how simple may the Java parallel code become using <code>omp4j</code>. It won't take more than
			10 seconds and it's definitely worth it, we promise. Just take a look at the following two examples:
		</p>

		<h3>Example #1 <small>parallel invocation</small></h3>
		<p>
			Simply type a comment in front of a code block and let the preprocessor do the parallel invocation for you.
			Easy, isn't it? As you may see, the source code remains serial. That's what makes <code>omp4j</code>
			so powerful. Develop serial code - run it in parallel. Awesome!
		</p>
		<pre>
// omp parallel threadNum(4)
{
	System.out.print("hello ")
}

/* output */
hello hello hello hello</pre>

		<h3>Example #2 <small>for-loop in parallel</small></h3>
		<p>
			Well, invoking a block of code in parallel doesn't seem to be that useful, does it? What about for-loop
			parallel execution? Yes, it is that simple! Let the for-loop run in parallel only with a simple comment
			before the loop itself. Can you think of a simpler solution? We don't think so :)
		</p>
		<pre>
// omp parallel for
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	System.out.print(i)
}

/* output */
2 0 6 7 1 9 5 3 4 8</pre>

		<h3>Further Examples <small>- we know you're hungry for more</small></h3>
		<p>
			Firstly, walk through our short <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>. You will learn how to run the preprocessor
			and everything about the directives (smart comments). And of course, the promised example are also provided.
		<p>
			Secondly, try <code>omp4j</code> online by using our <a href="/demo">demo</a>. You can either copy-paste
			the examples or modify them as you like.
